### Description

Designed to create a fairly simple game based on the online java game called Virus 2. I make no claim to the originality, in fact, Virus 2 can be found at: http://www.allgamesfree.com/games/

The code made to create this game does however show how to create and use Types, arrays, subroutines, nested loops, basic file I/O, testing using boolean logic, mesagebox, ToolTipText, and random numbers. cmdHelp also uses the tag property when clicked.

I hope that this may be useful for beginners or anyone who wants to make games in VB.

Very fast, with no API. Heavily commented.
